# Final-Assignment
This project is designed to simulate a full workflow of a Data Analyst from getting data off the Database to manipulate it with the use of Python and Pandas module to present it through matplotlib module or Tableau.


The concept is that we are given a dataset that contains Liquor Sales in the state of Iowa in USA between 2012-2020 and we are asked to find the most popular item per zipcode and the percentage of sales per store in the period between 2016-2019.

We are also asked to visualize the Data and present them in either a matplotlib format or in Tableau Public.

Every calculation and transformation of Data has to happen through a Python Script. 

## The following steps are just a recommendation, we suggest you trying and think outside the box while working with this data and maybe take different paths.


- ###### Step 1.

Add the Dataset provided to Workbench.

- ###### Step 2.

Use a Query to get all the columns of the table between the years 2016-2019

- ###### Step 3.

Export the data to an CSV file like shown below

- ###### Step 4.

Use Python and Pandas to Aggregate the CSV data so we can get the most popular item sold based on zip code and percentage of sales per store.

- ###### Step 5.

Use Matplotlib or Tableau with the newly made CSV file and present your Data.

- ###### Step 6.

Write a report of the steps you did and what difficulties you faced.

## The visualization should look similar to something like this, but you are free to experiment. :


### 1.  If you are using Matplotlib
